**CertiK Security Audit for {project_name}:**

‚ùå No CertiK audit found for this project.

**Security Recommendations:**
1. Check if the project has been audited by other reputable firms
2. Review the smart contract code on Etherscan/BSCScan
3. Look for bug bounty programs
4. Check if the contracts are verified and open-source
5. Assess the project's security practices and transparency

**Red Flags:**
‚Ä¢ Unaudited smart contracts
‚Ä¢ Closed-source code
‚Ä¢ No bug bounty program
‚Ä¢ Recent deployment with no security track record
‚Ä¢ Upgradeable contracts without proper governance

**Alternative Security Resources:**
‚Ä¢ OpenZeppelin audits
‚Ä¢ Trail of Bits audits
‚Ä¢ Quantstamp audits
‚Ä¢ PeckShield audits
‚Ä¢ Slowmist audits

Always prioritize projects with comprehensive security audits from reputable firms.
